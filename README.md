# Deep Learning-Based Customer Churn Prediction
## Project Description

This project aims to predict customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with a focus on comparing the effectiveness of two activation functions: Sigmoid and ReLU. Through detailed univariate and bivariate analysis followed by the application of deep learning models, we demonstrate that the ReLU activation function outperforms the Sigmoid in predicting customer churn. This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation for replicating the study and exploring the dataset and models used.
